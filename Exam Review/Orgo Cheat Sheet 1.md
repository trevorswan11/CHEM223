# Exam 1 Material to Include
![[O-Chem Notes Exam 1.pdf]]
## Chapter 1 - Structure and Bonding
#### Covalent Bonding
- [x] Polarity arrow points toward the more EN atom
	- [x] For the purposes of anything done in this class, the $\ce{C-H}$ bond is non-polar
- [x] Formal Charge Equation
- [x] Bonding Patterns Table - potential free points on Short answer or MCQ
- [x] **Do not, under any circumstances, put more than 4 bonds on a Carbon Atom**
- [x] Identify $\delta^+\text{ and }\delta^-$ in a covalent bond
#### Resonance Rules
- [x] Have as many atoms fill octet as possible
- [x] Has as many bonds as possible
- [x] Negative charge on the more EN atom
- [x] Prevent excess charge separation (3 max) 
- [x] **Resonance is not one contributor at one time and the other at a different time**
#### Orbitals (incl. Hybrid) and Overlap
- [x] When 2 orbitals overlap and are *out of phase*, they destructively overlap, forming an antibonding MO (molecular orbital)
- [x] Constructively overlapped orbitals are *in phase* and form a bonding MO
	- [x] Antibonding has higher energy
````ad-theory
title: Antibonding and Bonding MOs, and Nodes
These Concepts should be kept in mind when dealing with orbital overlap
- [x] There is a node in between the two halves of a P orbital
*A node is defined as having a 0 probability of finding an electron*
- [x] An antibonding orbital is created when the plus and minus of the orbital are aligned with each other
![[p and p overlap.png]]
![[p and s overlap.png]]
- [x] $\sigma\text{ bonds are single bonds.}\pi\text{ bonds are double/triple bonds}$
*$\sigma$ bonds are stronger than $\pi$ bonds*
- [x] For orbital overlap, the "*" symbol is used to denote antibonding
````
- [x] Hybridization Angle Summary
#### Less Energy is always going to be more stable
## Chapter 2 - Acids and Bases
#### Dipole Moments
- [x]  Molecules can have polar bonds but have a net zero molecular dipole moment
- [x] London dispersion forces are a result of induced dipoles, impact BP and MP
	- [x] The more surface area a molecule has, or the less branched it is, is reflected by a higher BP as their are strong LDFs
- [x] There must be an $\ce{N-H}\text{ or }\ce{O-H}$. The Hydrogen of a polar molecule, which has a $\delta^+$ charge, is extremely attracted to the $\delta^-$ charge on the more EN atom
- [x] Arrhenius Acids/Bases, Br√∏nsted Lowrey Acids/Bases, and Lewis Acids/Bases
	Know their relevance to the class and their differences
- [x] Molecules with similar Intermolecular forces will mix freely
- [x] Know how $pK_a$ is related to $K_a$. Specifically that a lower $pK_a$ correlates to a stronger acid
- [x] Electronegative atoms on a conjugate base will stabilize the negative charge held by the atom
	inductive effects and resonance stabilization makes stronger acids because their conjugate bases are more stable and therefore are stronger 
```ad-note
title: Difference between Inductive effect and Resonance Stabilization
The resonance structures of a product is more favorable and stabilizes more than the inductive effect. The inductive effect stabilizes a molecule through the delocalization of $e^-\text{ through the }\sigma$ bond while the Resonance effect stabilizes through the $\pi$ bond
```
- [x] More %s character correlates to a lower $pK_a$ which means a stronger acid
	Closer to nucleus so more stable
- [x] Lewis Acids (electrophiles) - Species that Accept a pair of electrons **Accepts!**
- [x] Lewis Bases (nucleophiles) - species with available electrons to accepts **Donates!**
- [x] Include Leaving group, The more EN atom, typically a Halogen, will receive the $e^-$ when breaking a bond
- [x] Arrow movement of electrons, specifically how electrons move between nucleo- and electrophiles
#### Functional Groups
- [x] Include examples of all common functional groups
- [x] Ethers and Esters cannot H-bond with themselves, but they can with water
## Chapter 3 - Stereochemistry of Alkanes
- [x] List all the different isomers and their definitions and how to distinguish
- [x] Formal nomenclature, common names and cyclic structures w their angles
- [x] Steric Strain vs Torsional Strain
- [x] Sketches of PERFECT chair conformations and all the axial/equatorial bonds
- [x] The reasoning behind the stability and lack thereof regarding the different orientations of Newman projections
	- Totally Eclipsed vs Eclipsed
	- Gauche interactions in cyclic and non-cyclic structures
	- Anti conformations
	- [x] Have all of these and their correlated energy with brief explanations
